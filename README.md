# KabaScript for Dockerized Symfony Application

KabaScript for Dockerized Symfony Application is set of Ansible playbooks to make symfony deployment easy, secured and reusable with Docker in production or uat servers.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- Docker >= 19.03.12
- Docker-compose >= 1.27.2

Windows user? Not tested Todo :)

## Installation

- Copy either `inventory.ini.exemple` into `inventory.ini` and edit it
- Make sure to setting these files and variables in it :

```shell
playbooks/group_vars/all/vault.yml
playbooks/group_vars/production/main.yml
playbooks/group_vars/production/vault.yml
playbooks/group_vars/uat/main.yml
playbooks/group_vars/uat/vault.yml
```

Otherwise you can override any file inside docker container

- Generate SSH key pair `ssh-keygen -t rsa` by naming `project_name_deploy` it according to your `ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/project_name_deploy` inside `inventory.ini` file

Depending on hosts you define in `Ã¬nventory.ini`, update uat in `playbooks/group_vars/uat/vault.yml` with the correct **host**, like this :

```shell
playbooks/group_vars/<host-your-defined-in-inventory>/vault.yml
```

In case you want to encrypt your vault files and you must generate one :

```shell
openssl rand -base64 64 > .vault_pass
```

If you don't want to, just remove this line `vault_password_file = .vault_pass` inside `ansible.cfg` and remove it corresponding file docker volume inside `run.sh`

- Also update `vault.sh` to fit your need

*Note*

Instead of mapping all keys inside your `~/.ssh` directory You can map only one key inside `run.sh` like this

```shell
-v ~/.ssh/project_name_deploy:/tmp/.ssh/project_name_deploy:ro \
```

## Usage

```
./run.sh -h
```

Example :

```shell
./run.sh deploy uat example.com -v
```

## Know issues

- For AWS EC2 server make sure to `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/aws-edu.pem`
- [Ansible python interpreter](https://www.toptechskills.com/ansible-tutorials-courses/how-to-fix-usr-bin-python-not-found-error-tutorial/)
- When deploying to use ssh forwarding, run this : [ssh forwarding](https://roots.io/docs/trellis/master/ssh-keys/#cloning-remote-repo-using-ssh-agent-forwarding)

On MacOS

```shell
ssh-add -K
```

Inside Docker container, we have to make sure `ssh_add` is working to be able to clone project

```shell
docker-compose exec master zsh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e env=uat -e site=google.dev.site.com
```

# SSH COPY

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/your_deploy.pub | ssh -i ~/.ssh/azure.pem ubuntu@20.188.62.225 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'
```

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your_deploy.pub ubuntu@20.188.62.225
```
