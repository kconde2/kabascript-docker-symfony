# KabaScript for Dockerized Symfony Application

KabaScript for Dockerized Symfony Application is set of Ansible playbooks to make symfony deployment easy, secured and reusable with Docker in production or staging servers.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- Docker >= 19.03.12
- Docker-compose >= 1.27.2

Windows user? Not tested Todo :)

## Installation

- Copy either `inventory.ini.exemple` into `inventory.ini` and edit it
- Make sure to setting these files :

```shell
ansible/group_vars/all/vault.yml
ansible/group_vars/production/vault.yml
ansible/group_vars/staging/vault.yml
```

Depending on hosts you define in `Ã¬nventory.ini`, update staging in `ansible/group_vars/staging/vault.yml` with the correct host, like this :

```shell
ansible/group_vars/<host-your-defined-in-inventory>/vault.yml
```

In case you want to encrypt your vault files and you must, generate one :

```shell
openssl rand -base64 64 > .vault_pass
```

## Usage

```
./run.sh -h
```

Example :

```shell
./run.sh staging example.com -v
```

## Know issues

- For AWS EC2 server make sure to `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/aws-edu.pem`
- [Ansible python interpreter](https://www.toptechskills.com/ansible-tutorials-courses/how-to-fix-usr-bin-python-not-found-error-tutorial/)
- When deploying to use ssh forwarding, run this : [ssh forwarding](https://roots.io/docs/trellis/master/ssh-keys/#cloning-remote-repo-using-ssh-agent-forwarding)

On MacOS

```shell
ssh-add -K
```

Inside Docker container, we have to make sure `ssh_add` is working to be able to clone project

```shell
docker-compose exec master zsh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e env=staging -e site=google.dev.site.com
```
